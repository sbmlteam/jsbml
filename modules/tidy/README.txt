1. COMPILATION
======================================================================

In order to compile or create the distribution of this module, you need
to have a full checkout of the jsbml trunk. Then, you need to compile
the jsbml-core if you haven't done it before as it is not done 
automatically for now.

You have to go into ../../core and run 'ant jar'.

Then to compile jsbml-tidy:

ant jar

To create the distribution:

ant dist


2. REPORTING BUGS AND OTHER PROBLEMS
======================================================================

We invite you to report bugs and other problems using the issue
tracker for JSBML on SourceForge.  The following URL will take you
there directly:

  http://sourceforge.net/p/jsbml/bugs/

You can also ask questions on the 'jsbml-development' and
'sbml-interoperability' mailing lists, either over email or using the
web forum interface (see below).  This may even have advantages, such
as that other people may also have experienced the issue and offer a
workaround more quickly than the JSBML developers can respond.

Finally, if you cannot get a timely response from the resources above,
you may contact the main JSBML developers directly by sending email to
'jsbml-team@caltech.edu'.


3. MAILING LISTS
======================================================================

There are two kinds of mailing lists available: normal discussion
lists for humans, and a SVN change notification list.

Discussion lists
----------------

All discussion lists, their web interfaces and their RSS feeds are at

                       http://sbml.org/Forums/

If you use SBML, we urge you to sign up for sbml-announce, the SBML
announcements mailing list.  It is a low-volume, broadcast-only list.

If you use JSBML, we also encourage you to subscribe to or monitor via
RSS the 'jsbml-development' list, where people discuss the development
and use of JSBML.  Being a member of libsbml-development will enable
you to keep in touch with the latest developments in JSBML as well as
to ask questions and share your experiences with fellow developers and
users of JSBML.

We also encourage you to subscribe to or monitor via RSS the
'sbml-interoperability' list, where people discuss the development,
use, and interoperability of software that supports SBML, including
JSBML.
