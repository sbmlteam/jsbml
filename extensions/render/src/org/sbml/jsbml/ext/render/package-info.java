/**
 * <p>
 * Provides classes for the render package, see the specification at <a
 * href="http://sbml.org/Community/Wiki/SBML_Level_3_Proposals/Rendering"
 * >sbml.org</a>. The rendering extension itself extends the layout extension.
 * Note that this extension can therefore not be used without having also a
 * layout defined in an SBML file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the rendering extension has been defined before the release of
 * SBML Level 3. Hence it is possible to write the extension in the annotation
 * section of the layout extension.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The first version of this package was implemented as part of the software
 * engineering class at the University of Tuebingen, Germany, in the summer
 * semester 2012, supervised by Johannes Eichner and Andreas Dr&#228;ger.
