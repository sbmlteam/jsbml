  <entry key="ArraysMathCheck.logMathVectorIrregular">For MathML operations with two or more operands involving MathML vectors or SBase objects with a list of Dimension objects, the number of dimensions and their size must agree for all operands unless the operand is a scalar type (i.e., it does not have a list of Dimension 31 objects). (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for" Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.5 on page 10.)</entry>
  <entry key="ArraysMathCheck.logSelectorInconsistency">The first argument of a MathML selector must be a MathML vector object or a valid identifier to an SBase object extended with a list of Dimension objects. (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.5 on page 10.)</entry>
  
  <entry key="DimensionArrayDimCheck.logArrayDimensionUniqueness">The ListOfDimensions associated with an SBase object must not have multiple Dimension objects with the same arrays:arrayDimension attribute. (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.3 on page 6.)</entry>
  <entry key="DimensionArrayDimCheck.logArrayDimensionMissing">The ListOfDimensions associated with an SBase object must have a Dimension object with arrays:arrayDimension attribute set to 0 before adding a Dimension object with arrays:arrayDimension attribute set to 1. Similarly, the ListOfDimensions in an SBase object must have Dimension objects, where one of them has arrays:arrayDimension attribute set to 0 and the other set to 1 before adding a Dimension object with arrays:arrayDimension attribute set to 2. (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.3 on page 6.)</entry>

  <entry key="DimensionSizeCheck.logMissingDimensionAttribute">A Dimension object must have a value for the attributes arrays:arrayDimension and arrays:size, and may additionally have the attributes arrays:id and arrays:name. (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.3 on page 6.)</entry>
  <entry key="DimensionSizeCheck.logDimensionSizeInvalid">The value of the arrays:size attribute, if set on a given Dimension object, must be a valid SIdRef to an object of type Parameter. (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.3 on page 6.)</entry>
  <entry key="DimensionSizeCheck.logDimensionSizeValueInconsistency">The value of the Parameter referenced by the arrays:size attribute must be a non-negative scalar constant integer. (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.3 on page 6.)</entry>
    
  <entry key="IndexArrayDimCheck.logArrayDimensionUniqueness">The ListOfIndices associated with an SBase object must not have multiple Index objects with the same arrays:arrayDimension attribute. (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.3 on page 6.)</entry>
  <entry key="IndexArrayDimCheck.logArrayDimensionMissing">The ListOfIndices associated with an SBase object must have a Index object with arrays:arrayDimension attribute set to 0 before adding a Index object with arrays:arrayDimension attribute set to 1. Similarly, the ListOfIndices in an SBase object must have Index objects, where one of them has arrays:arrayDimension attribute set to 0 and the other set to 1 before adding a Index object with arrays:arrayDimension attribute set to 2. (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.3 on page 6.)</entry>
  
  <entry key="IndexAttributesCheck.logDimensionMismatch">The object referenced by the SIdRef indicated by the arrays:referencedAttribute attribute must include an arrays:arrayDimension matching the arrays:arrayDimension for the Index. (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.4 on 37 page 8.)</entry>
  <entry key="IndexAttributesCheck.logNotBounded">For each possible value of each Dimension id (i.e., 0 to size-1 of the Dimension referred to) that appears in the MathML math element, there should be no array out-of-bounds problems. Namely, it must evaluate to a non-negative integer that is less than the size of the corresponding Dimension for the object being indexed.</entry>
  <entry key="IndexAttributesCheck.logNotStaticComp">The MathML math element in an Index object must be statically computable. In other words, any identifier that appears in the math element, other than a Dimension id for the object with this Index , must be a constant. (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.4 on page 8.)</entry>
  <entry key="IndexAttributesCheck.logIndexMissingAttribute">An Index object must have a value for the attributes arrays:arrayDimension, and arrays:referencedAttribute . (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.4 on page 8.)</entry>
  <entry key="IndexAttributesCheck.logInvalidRefAttribute">The value of the arrays:referencedAttribute attribute, if set on a given Index object, must be an existing attribute of type SIdRef with a value that references a valid SId. (Reference: SBML Level 3 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.4 on page 8.)</entry>
  
  <entry key="SBaseWithDimensionCheck.check">The object {0} cannot have a listOfDimensions.</entry>
  <entry key="SBaseWithDimensionCheck.logDimensionError">In SBML Level~3 Core, Models, FunctionDefinitions, Units, UnitDefinitions, KineticLaws, LocalParameters, Triggers, Priorities, and Delays are not permitted to have a ListOfDimensions. (Reference: SBML Level 3 11 Package Specification for Arrays, Version 1, Section 3.3 on page 7.)</entry>
