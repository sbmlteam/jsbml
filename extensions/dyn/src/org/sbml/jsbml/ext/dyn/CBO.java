/**
 * <p>
 * Methods for interacting with Cell Behavior Ontology (CBO) terms. This class
 * uses the BioJava classes for working with ontologies and contains static
 * classes to represent single {@link Term}s and {@link Triple}s of subject,
 * predicate, and object, where each of these three entities is again an
 * instance of {@link Term}. The classes {@link Term} and {@link Triple}
 * basically wrap the underlying functions from BioJava, but the original
 * {@link Object}s can be accessed via dedicated get methods. Furthermore, the
 * {@link Ontology} from BioJava, which is used in this class, can be obtained
 * using the method {@link #getOntology()}.
 * <p>
 * Cell Behavior Ontology and the cboTerm attribute It is difficult to determine
 * the semantics of Event constructs used to model intrinsic cellular behavior
 * from SBML attributes alone. The id attribute on Event objects allows for
 * unique identification and cross-referencing while the name attribute allows
 * the assignment of human readable labels to Events. Possible values for these
 * attributes are unrestricted so that modelers can choose whichever fits their
 * modeling framework and preference best. However, this means that without any
 * additional human intervention, software tools are unable to discern the
 * semantics of an extended Event element modeling dynamic behavior. For
 * instance, it would be inadvisable to interpret that an Event is modeling the
 * process of cellular death even if the id and name of such Event have the
 * string &ldquo;Cell Death&rdquo; as value. Additionally, as one may need to
 * convert a dynamic Event between different representations (e.g., Cellular
 * PottsModel vs. Center-based off-latticeModel), there is a need to provide a
 * standard, framework-independent, way of associating Event components with
 * given cellular processes. A solution inspired by SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core
 * is to associate model components with terms from carefully curated controlled
 * vocabularies (CVs) such as CBO. This is the purpose of the cboTerm provided
 * through the extended SBase class in this package.
