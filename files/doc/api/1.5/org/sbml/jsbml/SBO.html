<div class="block">Methods for interacting with Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) terms.
 
 <p>This class
 uses the BioJava classes for working with ontologies and contains static
 classes to represent single <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/ontology/Term.html" title="class in org.sbml.jsbml.ontology"><code>Term</code></a>s and <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/ontology/Triple.html" title="class in org.sbml.jsbml.ontology"><code>Triple</code></a>s of subject,
 predicate, and object, where each of these three entities is again an
 instance of <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/ontology/Term.html" title="class in org.sbml.jsbml.ontology"><code>Term</code></a>. The classes <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/ontology/Term.html" title="class in org.sbml.jsbml.ontology"><code>Term</code></a> and <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/ontology/Triple.html" title="class in org.sbml.jsbml.ontology"><code>Triple</code></a>
 basically wrap the underlying functions from BioJava, but the original
 <code>Object</code>s can be accessed via dedicated get methods. Furthermore, the
 <code>Ontology</code> from BioJava, which is used in this class, can also be
 obtained using the method <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/SBO.html#getOntology--"><code>getOntology()</code></a>.
 
 <p>
 The values of 'id' attributes on SBML components allow the components to
 be cross-referenced within a model. The values of 'name' attributes on
 SBML components provide the opportunity to assign them meaningful labels
 suitable for display to humans.  The specific identifiers and labels
 used in a model necessarily must be unrestricted by SBML, so that
 software and users are free to pick whatever they need.  However, this
 freedom makes it more difficult for software tools to determine, without
 additional human intervention, the semantics of models more precisely
 than the semantics provided by the SBML object classes defined in other
 sections of this document.  For example, there is nothing inherent in a
 parameter with identifier <code>k</code> that would indicate to a
 software tool it is a first-order rate constant (if that's what
 <code>k</code> happened to be in some given model).  However, one may
 need to convert a model between different representations (e.g.,
 Henri-Michaelis-Menten versus elementary steps), or to use it with
 different modeling approaches (discrete or continuous).  One may also
 need to relate the model components with other description formats such
 as SBGN (<a target='_blank'
 href='http://www.sbgn.org/'>http://www.sbgn.org/</a>) using deeper
 semantics.  Although an advanced software tool <em>might</em> be able to
 deduce the semantics of some model components through detailed analysis
 of the kinetic rate expressions and other parts of the model, this
 quickly becomes infeasible for any but the simplest of models.
 <p>
 An approach to solving this problem is to associate model components
 with terms from carefully curated controlled vocabularies (CVs).  This
 is the purpose of the optional 'sboTerm' attribute provided on the SBML
 class <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/SBase.html" title="interface in org.sbml.jsbml"><code>SBase</code></a>.  The 'sboTerm' attribute always refers to terms belonging
 to the Systems Biology Ontology (SBO).
 <p>
 <h2>Use of <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/SBO.html" title="class in org.sbml.jsbml"><code>SBO</code></a></h2>
 <p>
 Labeling model components with terms from shared controlled vocabularies
 allows a software tool to identify each component using identifiers that
 are not tool-specific.  An example of where this is useful is the desire
 by many software developers to provide users with meaningful names for
 reaction rate equations.  Software tools with editing interfaces
 frequently provide these names in menus or lists of choices for users.
 However, without a standardized set of names or identifiers shared
 between developers, a given software package cannot reliably interpret
 the names or identifiers of reactions used in models written by other
 tools.
 <p>
 The first solution that might come to mind is to stipulate that certain
 common reactions always have the same name (e.g., 'Michaelis-Menten'), but
 this is simply impossible to do: not only do humans often disagree on
 the names themselves, but it would not allow for correction of errors or
 updates to the list of predefined names except by issuing new releases
 of the SBML specification&mdash;to say nothing of many other limitations
 with this approach.  Moreover, the parameters and variables that appear
 in rate expressions also need to be identified in a way that software
 tools can interpret mechanically, implying that the names of these
 entities would also need to be regulated.
 <p>
 The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) provides terms for identifying most
 elements of SBML. The relationship implied by an 'sboTerm' on an SBML
 model component is <em>is-a</em> between the characteristic of the
 component meant to be described by SBO on this element and the SBO
 term identified by the value of the 'sboTerm'. By adding SBO term
 references on the components of a model, a software tool can provide
 additional details using independent, shared vocabularies that can
 enable <em>other</em> software tools to recognize precisely what the
 component is meant to be.  Those tools can then act on that information.
 For example, if the SBO identifier <code>'SBO:0000049'</code> is assigned
 to the concept of 'first-order irreversible mass-action kinetics,
 continuous framework', and a given <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/KineticLaw.html" title="class in org.sbml.jsbml"><code>KineticLaw</code></a> object in a model has an
 'sboTerm' attribute with this value, then regardless of the identifier
 and name given to the reaction itself, a software tool could use this to
 inform users that the reaction is a first-order irreversible mass-action
 reaction.  This kind of reverse engineering of the meaning of reactions
 in a model would be difficult to do otherwise, especially for more
 complex reaction types.
 <p>
 The presence of SBO labels on <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/Compartment.html" title="class in org.sbml.jsbml"><code>Compartment</code></a>, <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/Species.html" title="class in org.sbml.jsbml"><code>Species</code></a>, and <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/Reaction.html" title="class in org.sbml.jsbml"><code>Reaction</code></a>
 objects in SBML can help map those entities to equivalent concepts in
 other standards, such as (but not limited to) BioPAX (<a target='_blank'
 href='http://www.biopax.org/'>http://www.biopax.org/</a>), PSI-MI (<a
 target='_blank'
 href='http://www.psidev.info/index.php?q=node/60'>http://www.psidev.info</a>),
 or the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN, <a target='_blank'
 href='http://www.sbgn.org/'>http://www.sbgn.org/</a>).  Such mappings
 can be used in conversion procedures, or to build interfaces, with SBO
 becoming a kind of 'glue' between standards of representation.
 <p>
 The presence of the label on a kinetic expression can also allow
 software tools to make more intelligent decisions about reaction rate
 expressions.  For example, an application could recognize certain types
 of reaction formulas as being ones it knows how to solve with optimized
 procedures.  The application could then use internal, optimized code
 implementing the rate formula indexed by identifiers such as
 <code>'SBO:0000049'</code> appearing in SBML models.
 <p>
 Finally, SBO labels may be very valuable when it comes to model
 integration, by helping identify interfaces, convert mathematical
 expressions and parameters etc.
 <p>
 Although the use of SBO can be beneficial, it is critical to keep in
 mind that the presence of an 'sboTerm' value on an object <em>must not
 change the fundamental mathematical meaning</em> of the model.  An SBML
 model must be defined such that it stands on its own and does not depend
 on additional information added by SBO terms for a correct mathematical
 interpretation.  SBO term definitions will not imply any alternative
 mathematical semantics for any SBML object labeled with that term.  Two
 important reasons motivate this principle.  First, it would be too
 limiting to require all software tools to be able to understand the SBO
 vocabularies in addition to understanding SBML.  Supporting SBO is not
 only additional work for the software developer; for some kinds of
 applications, it may not make sense.  If SBO terms on a model are
 optional, it follows that the SBML model <em>must</em> remain
 unambiguous and fully interpretable without them, because an application
 reading the model may ignore the terms.  Second, we believe allowing the
 use of 'sboTerm' to alter the mathematical meaning of a model would
 allow too much leeway to shoehorn inconsistent concepts into SBML
 objects, ultimately reducing the interoperability of the models.
 <p>
 <h2>Relationships between <a href="../../../org/sbml/jsbml/SBO.html" title="class in org.sbml.jsbml"><code>SBO</code></a> and SBML</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of SBO labeling for SBML is to clarify to the fullest extent
 possible the nature of each element in a model.  The approach taken in
 SBO begins with a hierarchically-structured set of controlled
 vocabularies with six main divisions: (1) entity, (2) participant role,
 (3) quantitative parameter, (4) modeling framework, (5) mathematical
 expression, and (6) interaction.  The web site for SBO (<a
 target='_blank'
 href='http://biomodels.net/sbo'>http://biomodels.net</a>) should be
 consulted for the current version of the ontology.
 <p>
 The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) is not part of SBML; it is being
 developed separately, to allow the modeling community to evolve the
 ontology independently of SBML.  However, the terms in the ontology are
 being designed keeping SBML components in mind, and are classified into
 subsets that can be directly related with SBML components such as
 reaction rate expressions, parameters, and others.  The use of 'sboTerm'
 attributes is optional, and the presence of 'sboTerm' on an element does
 not change the way the model is <em>interpreted</em>.  Annotating SBML
 elements with SBO terms adds additional semantic information that may
 be used to <em>convert</em> the model into another model, or another
 format.  Although SBO support provides an important source of
 information to understand the meaning of a model, software does not need
 to support 'sboTerm' to be considered SBML-compliant.

<pre>public static&nbsp;int&nbsp;getGeneticInteraction()</pre>
<div class="block">A phenomenon whereby an observed phenotype, qualitative or quantative, is not explainable by the simple additive effects of the individual gene pertubations alone. Genetic interaction between perturbed genes is usually expected to generate a 'defective' phenotype. The level of defectiveness is often used to sub-classify this phenomenon.
 Biopax describes this as Genetic interactions between genes occur when two genetic perturbations (e.g. mutations) have a combined phenotypic effect not caused by either perturbation alone. A gene participant in a genetic interaction represents the gene that is perturbed. Genetic interactions are not physical interactions but logical (AND) relationships. Their physical manifestations can be complex and span an arbitarily long duration. Rationale: Currently, BioPAX provides a simple definition that can capture most genetic interactions described in the literature. In the future, if required, the definition can be extended to capture other logical relationships and different, participant specific phenotypes. Example: A synthetic lethal interaction occurs when cell growth is possible without either gene A OR B, but not without both gene A AND B. If you knock out A and B together, the cell will die.</div>

 Biopax describes this as an interaction in which participants bind physically to each other, directly or indirectly through intermediary molecules. Rationale: There is a large body of interaction data, mostly produced by high throughput systems, that does not satisfy the level of detail required to model them with ComplexAssembly class. Specifically, what is lacking is the stoichiometric information and completeness (closed-world) of participants required to model them as chemical processes. Nevertheless interaction data is extremely useful and can be captured in BioPAX using this class. Usage: This class should be used by default for representing molecular interactions such as those defined by PSI-MI level 2.5. The participants in a molecular interaction should be listed in the PARTICIPANT slot. Note that this is one of the few cases in which the PARTICPANT slot should be directly populated with instances (see comments on the PARTICPANTS property in the interaction class description). If all participants are known with exact stoichiometry, ComplexAssembly class should be used instead. Example: Two proteins observed to interact in a yeast-two-hybrid experiment where there is not enough experimental evidence to suggest that the proteins are forming a complex by themselves without any indirect involvement of other proteins. This is the case for most large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens.</div>
