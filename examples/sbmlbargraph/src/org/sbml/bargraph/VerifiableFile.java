/**
 * Extension of {@link java.io.File} that adds methods for easily
 * testing whether a given file or directory exists and is accessible.
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * <pre class="brush:java">
 * VerifiableFile file = new VerifiableFile("/tmp/foo");
 * if (file.isVerifiedExistingFile()) {
 *   //... do something;
 * } else {
 *   //... do something else;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note: The two-argument {@link VerifiableFile} constructors do not
 * interpret an empty parent abstract pathname as the current user
 * directory.  An empty parent instead causes the child to be resolved
 * against the system-dependent directory defined by the
 * {@code FileSystem.getDefaultParent} method.  On Unix this default
 * is {@code "/"}, while on Win32 it is {@code "\\"}.  This is
 * the behavior documented in the {@code java.io.File} classes.
 * @file    VerifiableFile.java
 * @brief   Enhancement of the basic Java File class
