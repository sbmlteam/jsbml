<p> JSBML is a community-driven project to create a free, open-source, pure Java library for reading, writing, and manipulating SBML files and data streams. It is an alternative to the mixed Java/native code-based interface provided in <a href="http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML">libSBML</a>. The JSBML project's aim is to provide an SBML parser and programming library that maps all SBML elements to a flexible and extended type hierarchy. Where possible, JSBML strives to attain 100% API compatibility with the libSBML Java API, to facilitate a switch from one library to the other.
<p> The user guide can be found at the <a href = "http://sbml.org/Special/Software/JSBML/latest-stable/doc/user_guide/User_Guide.pdf">JSBML User Guide</a> webpage.
