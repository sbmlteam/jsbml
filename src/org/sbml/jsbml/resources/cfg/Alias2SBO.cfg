# Aliases are a construct introduced and used by CellDesigner.
# Their purpose is to provide a similar but rather limited
# annotation system as the Systems Biology Ontology (SBO).
# This file provides a mapping between all those aliases and
# the SBO. Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a
# one-to-one matching because some aliases don't have an exact
# equivalent in the SBO, e.g., "inhibition" and "translational
# inhibition" can both only represented by SBO:0000020.
# The usage of this mapping file simplifies the implementation
# of the SBO class in jsbml and makes the usage of certain SBO
# terms more transparent.
#
# PLEASE NOTE:
# Some of the aliases cannot be mapped to a SBO term with the same or
# with a very similar name. However, it is most important to have a
# unique mapping from aliases to SBO terms and back. Therefore, it is
# highly discouraged to reuse the same SBO term more than once.
