/**
 * A special {@link EventObject} to notify a {@link TreeNodeChangeListener}
 * about a removed node and its previous position within the tree. To this end,
 * this {@link TreeNodeRemovedEvent} contains a pointer to both the actual
 * removed node and its previous parent node. Note that when removing an element
 * from the SBML tree, its pointer to its parent is set to {@code null}.
 * To give an example why information about the previous parent is necessary:
 * Imagine, an instance of {@code speciesReference} has been removed from
 * the SBML tree. After removing it, the model does no longer point to an
 * element with its id. Many {@code reaction}s
 * might have been the origin of this removed node. If a
 * {@link TreeNodeChangeListener} wants to, e.g., undo this change,
 * it is necessary to identify the previous position of the node within the
 * tree. That's why this class has two important
 * methods, namely {@link #getSource()} and {@link #getPreviousParent()}.
