	systems is at the heart of systems biology. Model structures, simulation
	descriptions and numerical results can be encoded in structured formats,
	but there is an increasing need to provide an additional semantic
	layer. Semantic information adds meaning to components of structured
	descriptions to help identify and interpret them unambiguously. Ontologies
	are one of the tools frequently used for this purpose. We describe
	here three ontologies created specifically to address the needs of
	the Systems Biology community. The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO)
	provides semantic information about the model components. The Kinetic
	Simulation Algorithm Ontology (KiSAO) supplies information about
	existing algorithms available for the simulation of Systems Biology
	models, their characterization, and interrelationships. The Terminology
	for the Description of Dynamics (TEDDY) categorizes dynamical features
	of the simulation results and general systems behavior. The provision
	of semantic information extends a model's longevity and facilitates
	its reuse. It provides useful insight into the biology of modeled
	processes, and may be used to make informed decisions on subsequent
	simulation experiments.},

	for Java users, including the ability to distribute software as Java
	Web Start applications. JSBML supports all SBML Levels and Versions

	JSBML also supports modules that can facilitate the development of
	plugins for end-user applications, as well as ease migration from
	a libSBML-based backend.

  abstract = {In recent years biology has shifted its focus from the mainly descriptive
	exploration of individual organisms, cells, or molecules towards
	a holistic investigation of the complex interactions within living
	systems. This progress is driven by the development of large-scale
	measurement techniques, e.g., the timely resolved simultaneous quantification
	of many cellular components. The exploration of these data sets requires
	the application of methods from other areas of natural science and
	the development of novel analysis methods. At this intersection systems
	biology aims to understand mutual interactions and influences between
	biological components. Control mechanisms and regulation of processes,
	which often show a nonlinear behavior, are to be described. Predicting
	the dynamics of complex interaction systems constitutes its main
	challenge.
	
	Computational modeling methods play a central role to attain this
	goal. Without loss of generality, we here focus on metabolic systems
	in preparation for an extension to gene-regulatory systems. Physico-chemical,
	in particular thermodynamic, constraints restrict the investigated
	systems and define the domain of plausible and valid models. Setting
	up such a mathematical description is not only complicated and highly
	error-prone, it also requires knowledge from many different fields
	and is therefore not easily applicable for non-experts. This thesis
	aims at the development of a method that performs the model construction
	steps to the widest extent automatically, reducing the number of
	necessary human interactions to a minimum but that still leads to
	thermodynamically feasible and correct model systems.
	
	To this end, it introduces a five-step modeling pipeline that ultimately
	leads to a mathematical description of a biochemical reaction system.
	We discuss how to automate each individual step and how to put these
	steps together: First, we create a topology of interconversion processes
	and mutual influences between reactive species encoded in the Systems
	Biology Markup Language (SBML) including semantic information. Second,
	a procedure is established that generates kinetic equations in a
	context-sensitive manner. The resulting model can then be combined
	with already existing models. Third, we estimate the values of all
	newly introduced parameters in each created rate law. This procedure
	requires that a time series of quantitative measurements of the reactive
	species within this system be available, because we calibrate the
	parameters with the aim that the model will fit these experimental
	data. The applicability and functioning of these approaches is demonstrated
	on a model of the valine and leucine biosynthesis in \emph{C.~glutamicum}.
	In a large-scale benchmark the results of seven modeling techniques
	are systematically compared when estimating their parameters with
	a multitude of nature-inspired heuristic optimization processes.
	This step is crucial for the development of an automatic modeling
	procedure because it highlights the strength and weaknesses of all
	these approaches. Fourth, an experimental validation of the resulting
	model is advisable. Fifth, a model report is generated automatically
	to document the model with all of its components.
	
	In an extension, this computer-aided modeling pipeline is further
	developed to a fully automatic procedure, the AMUSE algorithm (Automated
	Modeling Using Specialized Enzyme kinetics). The network topology
	in form of an SBML file and biological reference data, i.e., at least
	one time-series of participating metabolite concentrations and some
	relevant target fluxes, build its only required input. Based on latest
	estimation methods for standard reaction Gibbs energies, AMUSE determines
	a thermodynamically feasible, minimal equilibrium configuration of
	the system, identifies the key reactions and selects kinetic equations
	describing all reaction velocities. Furthermore, it estimates all
	remaining parameters with respect to given experimental data.
	
	For a better understanding, we begin with an introduction to fundamental
	modeling and generalized approaches for common rate equations. Subsequently,
	parameter estimation techniques are introduced and evaluated on the
	valine and leucine biosynthesis in \emph{C.~glutamicum}. Thereafter,
	standardization attempts in systems biology will be discussed that
	are required for the computer-aided modeling pipeline. This pipeline
	necessitates extending the existing standards. In particular, the
	development and implementation of JSBML, the Java library for SBML,
	has been conducted to simplify computation and manipulation of complex
	models. A discussion of possible further improvements and an extension
	of the suggested modeling pipeline to gene-regulatory networks completes
	this thesis.},

  month = {April},
  abstract = {Background
	
	The development of complex biochemical models has been facilitated
	through the standardization of machine-readable representations like
	SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language). This effort is accompanied
	by the ongoing development of the human-readable diagrammatic representation
	SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation). The graphical SBML editor
	CellDesigner allows direct translation of SBGN into SBML, and vice
	versa. For the assignment of kinetic rate laws, however, this process
	is not straightforward, as it often requires manual assembly and
	specific knowledge of kinetic equations.
	
	Results
	
	SBMLsqueezer facilitates exactly this modeling step via automated
	equation generation, overcoming the highly error-prone and cumbersome
	process of manually assigning kinetic equations. For each reaction
	the kinetic equation is derived from the stoichiometry, the participating
	species (e.g., proteins, mRNA or simple molecules) as well as the
	regulatory relations (activation, inhibition or other modulations)
	of the SBGN diagram. Such information allows distinctions between,
	for example, translation, phosphorylation or state transitions. The
	types of kinetics considered are numerous, for instance generalized
	mass-action, Hill, convenience and several Michaelis-Menten-based
	kinetics, each including activation and inhibition. These kinetics
	allow SBMLsqueezer to cover metabolic, gene regulatory, signal transduction
	and mixed networks. Whenever multiple kinetics are applicable to
	one reaction, parameter settings allow for user-defined specifications.
	After invoking SBMLsqueezer, the kinetic formulas are generated and
	assigned to the model, which can then be simulated in CellDesigner
	or with external ODE solvers. Furthermore, the equations can be exported
	to SBML, LaTeX or plain text format.
	
	Conclusion
	
	SBMLsqueezer considers the annotation of all participating reactants,
	products and regulators when generating rate laws for reactions.
	Thus, for each reaction, only applicable kinetic formulas are considered.
	This modeling scheme creates kinetics in accordance with the diagrammatic
	representation. In contrast most previously published tools have
	relied on the stoichiometry and generic modulators of a reaction,
	thus ignoring and potentially conflicting with the information expressed
	through the process diagram. Additional material and the source code
	can be found at the project homepage (URL found in the Availability
	and requirements section).},

	biological processes, the development of quantitative models is no

	A recent conference (Kitano, 2001) highlights the range of topics

	initiatives demonstrate the growing popularity of this kind of multidisciplinary
	work (e.g., Abbott, 1999; Gilman, 2000; Popel and Winslow, 1998;
	Smaglik, 2000a,b). SBML Level 1 is the result of merging modeling-language
	features from the following simulation systems: BioSpice (Arkin,
	2001), DBSolve (Goryanin, 2001; Goryanin et al., 1999), E-Cell (Tomita
	et al., 1999, 2001), Gepasi (Mendes, 1997, 2001), Jarnac (Sauro,

	was developed with the help of the authors of these packages. As
	a result of being based on actual working simulation software, it
	is a practical and functional description language. Our goal in creating
	it has been to provide an open standard that will enable simulation
	software to exchange models, something that is currently impossible
	because there is no standard model exchange language. We expect SBML
	models to be encoded using XML, the eXtensible Markup Language (Bosak

  abstract = {BioModels Database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ biomodels/), part of the
	international initiative BioModels.net, provides access to published,
	peerreviewed, quantitative models of biochemical and cellular systems.
	Each model is carefully curated to verify that it corresponds to
	the reference publication and gives the proper numerical results.
	Curators also annotate the components of the models with terms from
	controlled vocabularies and links to other relevant data resources.
	This allows the users to search accurately for the models they need.
	The models can currently be retrieved in the SBML format, and import/export
	facilities are being developed to extend the spectrum of formats
	supported by the resource.},
