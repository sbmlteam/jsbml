       * implementation is provided by the SBML2LaTeX tool

       * separation between TextGlyphs (labels) and SpeciesGlyphs (~nodes)
       * present in SBML directly
       * Apart from the read-in file, the Director then gets a LayoutBuilder and
       * a LayoutAlgorithm.
       * In this example, the LayoutAlgorithm will only position the TextGlyphs
       * (of which some are
       * not yet positioned).
       * Further explanations are provided in the BasicLayoutBuilder and
       * BasicLayoutAlgorithm classes, as well as in the LaTeXSBGNArc and
       * LaTeXSBGNProcessNode classes.
