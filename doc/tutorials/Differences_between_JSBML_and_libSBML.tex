\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Although the libraries JSBML and libSBML, used to work with files and data
structures defined in SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language), are
very similar and share a common scope, users should be informed about their
major differences to help switch more easily from one library to the other. To
this end, the document at hand gives a brief overview of the main differences
between the Java\texttrademark{} application programming interfaces (API) of
both libraries.

In addition, JSBML can be used as a communication layer between the widespread
application CellDesigner and any application that works with JSBML as its
internal data structure. An example is given, that demonstrates how to
convert between CellDesigner's plug-in data structures and JSBML objects.

In the same way, it is possible to inter-convert between data structures
obtained from libSBML and JSBML. We provide an example of how to read SBML files
with libSBML, turn them into JSBML data structures, manipulate them and turn
them back to libSBML for writing.

Furthermore, JSBML will provides a compatibility module, whose member classes
show an identical API as defined in libSBML. In this way, the
compatibility module will facilitate a switch from libSBML to JSBML and vice
versa by simply exchanging the included JAR file in the project.

%\textcolor{red}{This document gives an example for the usage of the
%compatibility module.}
% Not sure we need to mention in the abstract that we gives examples code for
% each point and anyway, there is not example at the moment for this module.

% I removed the line return for the \index to try to remove the extra spaces
% that were added.
