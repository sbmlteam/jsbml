# JSBML-1.5


We are pleased to announce the release of JSBML-1.5, which is now available for download from GitHub (above).

JSBML is a community-driven project to create a free, open-source, pure Java library for reading, writing, and manipulating
[SBML](http://sbml.org) files and data streams. It is an alternative to the mixed Java/native code-based interface provided 
in [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML).

For more details, please visit the JSBML project home page:

<http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML>

This is mainly a bug fix release. 

You can find a detailed list of the user-visible new features and bug fixes since JSBML version 1.4 on the [NEWS](NEWS.md) file.

Thank you for your interest and support of JSBML and SBML in general.

## The JSBML team.
