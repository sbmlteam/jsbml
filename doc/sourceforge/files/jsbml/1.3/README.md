J S B M L   1.3
=====

JSBML is a free, open-source programming library to help you read, write, manipulate, translate, and validate SBML files and data streams. It is not an application itself (though it does come with example programs), but rather a library you can embed in your own applications.

This is the top-level directory of the JSBML 1.3 release. Here you will find the following:

* [jsbml-1.3.jar](jsbml-1.3.jar)  -- jar file containing the classes of JSBML-1.3
  
* [jsbml-1.3-with-dependencies.jar](jsbml-1.3-with-dependencies.jar)  -- jar file containing the classes of JSBML-1.3 including all of the currently supported SBML L3 packages and any needed dependencies libraries classes.
  
* [jsbml-1.3-full.zip](jsbml-1.3-full.zip)  -- full distribution of JSBML-1.3 containing the  two jars file described above plus the sources and documentation along with the build script to be able to compile the library.


Please note: some of the code for the SBML Level 3 packages reflects the current state of development of each packages. Many of the SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of development. The code available may be untested and is supplied 'as-is' for experimental development only.
