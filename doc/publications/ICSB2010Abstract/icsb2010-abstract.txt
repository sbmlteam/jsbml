The XML-based Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is the
de facto standard file format for the storage and exchange
of biochemical network models, and is supported by more than
180 software packages to date. Much of this success is due
to SBML's clearly defined specifications and the
availability of libSBML, a portable, robust and easy-to-use
library.
 
LibSBML provides many methods for manipulating and
validating SBML files through its Application Programming
Interface (API). Originally written in C and C++, libSBML
also provides automatically-generated language bindings for
Java, MATLAB, Perl, Python, and many more. However, the
platform independence of Java is compromised in libSBML due
to the fact that the language binding is a wrapper around
the C/C++ core. The real-world experiences of many software
developers has been that the deployment of portable
libSBML-based Java applications is difficult. Further, the
libSBML API and type hierarchy are not sufficiently
intuitive from a Java programmer's perspective simply
because they were not designed directly for Java.

For these reasons, several groups in the SBML community have
mounted an open-source effort to develop a pure Java library
for SBML. Here we present the JSBML project, whose products
are freely available at the website
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsbml. The JSBML project's
aim is to provide an SBML parser and programming library
that maps all SBML elements to a flexible and extended type
hierarchy. Where possible, JSBML strives to attain 100% API
compatibility with the libSBML Java API, to facilitate a
switch from one library to the other for those who desire
it. 

Currently, JSBML supports all constructs for SBML up to the
latest Level 3 Version 1 release candidate specification,
including an API to add SBML extensions. There are no plans
to re-implement some of the more complex functions of
libSBML, since separate community efforts are expected to
make them available to JSBML via web services. These more
complex functions include model consistency checking, SBML
validation, and the conversion between different SBML Levels
and Versions.

In summary, JSBML is a young, ongoing software project that
provides comprehensive and entirely Java-based data
structures to read, write, and manipulate SBML files. Its
layered architecture allows for the creation of
Java web start applications and CellDesigner plug-ins based
on stand-alone programs with very little effort. One
program, SBMLsqueezer 1.3, has already been re-implemented
and released using JSBML, and many others are planned.
